__PREFIX__ = "This module focuses on genes and their functions that are differentially between groups. You can select a specific cell type for comparison between groups, or you can select a specific sample or group for comparison between cell subtypes. For the obtained differential genes, we can use heat maps, volcano maps, etc. to clearly show the differences between groups, and we can also use GSEA AND GO/KEGG pathway enrichment analysis to compare the biological functional differences between groups."
